==========

Project created during the AppJam2014.

It is a game in which you have to snatch food from the screen, but pay attention to the bad one. 
If you get bad food you will lose a life and evetually lose the game. 
There is also covered food which will be uncovered for a brief time and it's supposed to give you more points if you manage to get the Good food.
